*Install Salt Master and Slave with pull-architecture.*

Following these instructions I started by installing Salt Master and checked my IP-address. I also made couple of holes to the firewall for Salt.

Master:

  sudo apt install salt-master
  hostname -I
  sudo ufw allow 4505/tcp
  sudo ufw allow 4506/tcp

Installed Salt Minion for the slave

Slave:

	sudo apt install salt-minion

I then modified minion-file. I added masters IP-address so that slave knows where to connect and named the slave computer as slave

Slave:

  sudoedit /etc/salt/minion

  master: “master IP”
  id: slave


and restarted salt minion

Slave

	sudo systemctl restart salt-minion.service


The slave should have now sent a slave key to master.

I checked if there were unaccepted keys, found one and accepted it.

Master

	sudo salt-key -A

To test that I actually had a connection I ran some commands

Master

  sudo salt '*' cmd.run 'whoami'
  sudo salt '*' grains.item virtual
  sudo salt '*' grains.items|less
  sudo salt '*' cmd.run 'ls /home/xubuntu'

![] (images/h1/Selection_045.png)

Everything looks ok.

## d) & f)	

*Try out one of the states from https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/tree/master/salt/srv/salt or modify one of them*

I used these instructions as a reference.

Using master I started by creating /srv/salt -folder

	sudo mkdir /srv/salt

to make sure everything works right, I created a test state called “hello”

	sudoedit /srv/salt/hello.sls
	
	/home/xubuntu/terve.txt:
  	  file.managed:
    	    - source: salt://terve.txt

(.sls files are written in YAML, so indentation is done with spacebar, not tab)
and a file called terve.txt to copy to the slave.

  sudoedit /srv/salt/terve.txt


	
To get the file to the slave I had to apply it

	sudo salt '*' state.apply hello

Here I’m applying a state called “hello” once to all (‘*’) my minions.

It’s very important to make sure that every computer has cmatrix and cowsay always installed and my minion(s) are no exception. The top.sls -state applies periodically automatically so that’s the perfect tool for this occasion.

I created a folder called important

	sudo mkdir /srv/salt/important

and because I figured I might need to take screenshots with the slave, I also created a folder called shutter, which would be used to install shutter

	sudo mkdir /srv/salt/shutter

After that I created two init.sls files, one for important and one for shutter

	sudoedit /srv/salt/important/init.sls

	install_important:
 	  pkg.installed:
      - pkgs:
        - cmatrix
      	- cowsay


	sudoedit /srv/salt/shutter/init.sls

	shutter:
    pkg.installed


and top.sls -file

	sudoedit /srv/salt/top.sls

	base:
    '*':
   	  - important
    	- shutter


I used 

	sudo salt '*' state.highstate

to apply top.sls immediately.

## e)

*Use Grains to collect system information*

The command

	sudo salt '*' grains.items

dumps a bunch of information about the minions system(s) like IP -address, operating system, gpu etc.

![] (images/h1/Selection_048.png)

	sudo salt '*' grains.ls

lists available grains

![] (images/h1/Selection_049.png)

and

  sudo salt '*' grains.item “anything from the previous list”

gives info about specific grain.

I checked out my slaves gpu,

	sudo salt '*' grains.item gpus
  
![] (images/h1/Selection_050.png)

cpu model

	sudo salt '*' grains.item cpu_model

![] (images/h1/Selection_051.png)

and memory

	sudo salt '*' grains.item mem_total
	
![] (images/h1/Selection_052.png)
