### *Upload /srv/salt into Github and clone it to your computer*
<br></br>
<br></br>
I followed [these](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/) instructions on how to add existing project into Github. 

Firtst step was to create an empty repo into Github.

I started by clicking the green "New" button under the "Repositories" -tab. The instructions said that initializing the repository with README, licence or gitignore files could lead to errors and should be added after pushing the project into Github, so I didn't do any of that.

Next I initialized the salt folder in /srv/salt,

	cd /srv/salt
	sudo git init

added the files within /salt to the local repository

	sudo git add .

committed the files with very original "First commit" message,

	sudo git commit -m "First commit"
	
added the url for the remote repository that I just created. The url is the repos url with .git added to the end.	
	
	sudo git remote add origin https://github.com/juhavee/salt.git

and pushed the changes to Github.

	sudo git push -u origin master

As you can see from the dates in the screenshot, I had initialized and made changes to the files earlier. For that reason the "First commit" message ended up applying only to a small change I made to a file in the ssh folder just a bit before I started doing this assignment.

Before moving on I created README and LICENCE files.

#### Cloning a repository

To clone the repository I had to first delete salt folder

	cd /srv
	 sudo rm -r salt/
	 
and after checking that it was gone I cloned it from Github with

	 sudo git clone https://github.com/juhavee/salt.git
