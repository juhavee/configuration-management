## a) *Creating a script that turns your computer into salt slave*
<br></br>
<br></br>
I used one of my older school [excercises](https://wordpress.com/post/juhaveijalainen.wordpress.com/90) as a reference and created the following script.

```bash
nano saltminion
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install salt-minion -y
echo -e 'master: MASTERS IP ADDRESS\nid: autominion' |sudo tee /etc/salt/minion
sudo systemctl restart salt-minion
```		

The script 

- updates the system
- installs salt-minion
- replaces the wall of text in /etc/salt/minion with	
	
	>master: MASTERS IP ADDRESS
	>id: autominion

- restarts salt-minion  

I gave the script proper rights and ran it.
```bash
chmod a+x saltminion
./saltminion
```	
To make sure that my script worked I switched to master and checked salt keys,
```bash
sudo salt-key
```
accepted keys
```bash
sudo salt-key -A
```
and tested that there really was a connection between master and slave
```bash
sudo salt '*' cmd.run 'whoami'
```

*Script seems to be working*

## c) *Installing Vagrant and trying out an image from Atlas*
<br></br>
I already had Vagrant installed  so decided to do this excercise using a clean Xubuntu 18.04.1 live usb stick.

I begun by installing Vagrant and Virtualbox

	sudo apt install -y vagrant virtualbox
	
and made sure that both worked.
```bash
mkdir vagr
cd vagr/
vagrant init bento/ubuntu-18.04
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmatrix
cmatrix 
```

Now that I could be reasonably sure that everything worked I exited and destroyed the Xubuntu box.
```bash
exit
vagrant destroy
```
I navigated to https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search and picked [offensive-security/kali-linux](https://app.vagrantup.com/offensive-security/boxes/kali-linux) to try out.

```bash
mkdir kali
cd kali
vagrant init offensive-security/kali-linux
vagrant up
```
Unfortunately, after a while, the image download failed with the following error code:
>Failed writing body (641 != 16360)

I'm assuming I ran out of disc space since I was using a live usb stick.

I tried again, this time with [bento/centos-7.2](https://app.vagrantup.com/bento/boxes/centos-7.2).

```bash
mkdir centos
cd centos
vagrant init bento/centos-7.2
vagrant up
```
This time everything went fine and after typing in

	vagrant ssh
	
the CentOS' terminal opened up.

I finished by entering a few commands to confirm that everything worked.
```bash
sudo yum -y update
sudo yum install nano
nano centos
```
